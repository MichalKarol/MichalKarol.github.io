It it due to the necessity of full software stack (like in Docker container inside a production stack) or due to special hardware requirements, VSCode in Insider version allows us to do exactly that. By using SSH to run server and extensions fully remotely thus limiting CPU usage on thin client, we can fully utilise the editor's power.\n\n## Necessary tools\nIn order to use VSCode remotely it is needed:\n1) Host with SSH server with allowed TCP port forwarding and installed wget or curl\n2) [VSCode Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)\n3) Extension - [(Remote -  SSH)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)\n\n\n## Example usecase\nMy personal usecase is developing my masters degree on remote host with sufficient NVidia card for ML but without any screen connected.\n\n#### ~/.ssh/config (on client)\n```\nHost hostname\n    HostName host_ip\n    User user\n```\n\n\n#### /etc/ssh/sshd_config (on host)\n```\n...\nAllowTcpForwarding yes\n...\n``` \n  \n  \nAdding automatic installation of Python extension on every VSCode remote server.\n#### settings.json (in VSCode)\n```\n...\n\"remote.SSH.defaultExtensions\": [\n    \"ms-python.python\"\n]\n...\n```\n\n\n\n## Dockerfile with SSH server \nThis image is useful to create remote development environments. On localhost other extension is more appropriate: [(Remote - Containers)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)\n\n``` dockerfile\nFROM ubuntu:latest\n\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n apt-get install -y openssh-server && \\\n mkdir /var/run/sshd && \\\n echo 'root:root' |chpasswd && \\\n sed -ri 's/^#?PermitRootLogin\\s+.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \\\n sed -ri 's/^#?AllowTcpForwarding\\s+.*/AllowTcpForwarding yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \\\n mkdir /root/.ssh && \\\n apt-get clean && \\\n rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*\n\nCMD \"/usr/sbin/sshd -D\"\n```\n\n## Summary\nIt is very useful to work fully remotely with notebook only as a thin client. \nFor Linux-only applications development on VPS with Windows OS on personal laptop this solution \nactually worked really well as a replacement of other solutions like dual-boot or VM.\n\nHowever this method of development has major drawback: development lock on any connection issue. Therefore usage of this solution must me carefully considered.\n"}}]);

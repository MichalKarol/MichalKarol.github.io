With frameworks like Vue it is quite easy task to change our static HTML page to almost functional SPA.\n\n### IDE\nAs a VSCode user my recommendation is installing [Vetur plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur).  \nIt definitely helps during development by displaying warnings and errors in .vue files thus allowing for faster debugging.\nAlso [Vue devtools extension](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) to Chrome is a nice addition.\n\n### Used technology\n* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - type safe programming language compiled into JavaScript\n* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript framework allowing to build Single Page Application\n* [Bulma](https://bulma.io) - CSS framework using Flexbox with great customization options\n* [MarkdownIt](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) - Markdown parser allowing to generate HTML content, like this one\n* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) - JavaScript library for syntax highlight in generated Markdown content\n* [Facebook Comments Plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/) - plugin adding commenting ability for page\n* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - library for OpenStreetMap online map widget in 'About me' page\n* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - hosting for static user page\n\n\n### Initialization\n\nLet's prepare our repository. Name of the repository for personal page must be in format: '${name_of_account}.github.io'.  \nWith initialized repository, let's clone it to our machine and begin installing npm packages by following [Vue CLI Tutorial](https://cli.vuejs.org):\n\n``` sh\nnpm install -g @vue/cli \n```\n\nand start Web UI using:\n\n``` sh\nvue ui\n```\n\nand then create a new project and select options. \nIMPORTANT: Create a subdirectory in repository eg. site/ where the main files will be kept, so later dist/ directory would not contaminate our development files. \nPersonally preferred by me options are TypeScript, Router and Vuex. Then you only have to create own site following one of many available Vue tutorials.\n\n\n### Deployment\n\n1. Build production version of application with:\n``` sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\n2. Due to to fact that contents of dist/ directory must be in root directory of repository:\n``` sh\nmv dist/* ./..\n```\n\n3. And it is done. Validate that by running python server in repository root directory:\n``` sh\npython3 -m http.server $PORT\n```"}}]);
